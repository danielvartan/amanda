# Introduction [line 52]

## Wild food plants [line 57]

*Fig 3.* Wild food plants with greater potential for popularization, considering the average of the attributes accessed according to the perception of the residents of the rural settlement Dom Helder CÃ¢mara, in the municipality of Murici, state of Alagoas, northeastern Brazil. (**A**) *Psidium guineense* Sw.; (**B**) *American genipa* L.; (**C**) *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* (L.) Schott, and (**D**) *Dioscorea trifida* L.f. [@medeiros2021].

## The Brazilian semiarid [line 87]

**Fig. 1** Geographic location of the Brazilian semiarid region in the Neotropical realm, with limits highlighted in black on a phytogeographic map. The relative area (%) represents the proportion of each domain in relation to the total area of the semiarid region.

A more precise definition is given by the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, which treats steppe climates (BSh and BSk) as **intermediates between desert climates (BW) and humid climates** (A, C, D) in ecological characteristics and agricultural potential <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate>.

## Climate change and WFPs [line 148]

## Question [line 167]

Here, our objective was to determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of WFPs in the Brazilian semiarid and evaluate their potential availability in future climate change scenarios [@silva2024].

# Methods [line 182]

# Results [line 187]

## WFP in future CC scenarios [line 192]

**Fig. 2** Relative balance in the geographical distribution area of wild food plants of the Brazilian semiarid in future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). 
The relative balance (bars) indicates the balance between gain and loss in the distribution area of each species and is proportional to the current (1970â€“2000) distribution area. Boxplots show the median, quartiles, and standard error of the relative balance of all species ($n = 27$) in each future scenario; points represent outliers (*Dipteryx alata Vogel*). Nega- tive values indicate a reduction in distribution area, and positive values indicate an increase [@silva2024].

## Species richness [line 205]

**Fig. 3** Species richness and spatial beta diversity of wild food plants (hexagons) in the Brazilian semiarid. **a** Species richness in the cur- rent scenario (1970â€“2000) and in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). **b** Variation of species richness in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). **c** Spatial beta diversity in the current scenario (1970â€“2000) and in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). Spatial beta diversity quantifies the difference in species composition between a focal cell and its surrounding cells (0.5Â° radius). **d** Variation of spatial beta diversity in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). Boxplots show the median, quartiles, and standard error of the variation ($n = 430$) in each future scenario. Negative values indicate reductions (red) and positive values indicate increases (green) [@silva2024].

## Spatial beta diversity [line 217]

**Fig. 3** Species richness and spatial beta diversity of wild food plants (hexagons) in the Brazilian semiarid. **a** Species richness in the cur- rent scenario (1970â€“2000) and in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). **b** Variation of species richness in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). **c** Spatial beta diversity in the current scenario (1970â€“2000) and in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). Spatial beta diversity quantifies the difference in species composition between a focal cell and its surrounding cells (0.5Â° radius). **d** Variation of spatial beta diversity in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). Boxplots show the median, quartiles, and standard error of the variation ($n = 430$) in each future scenario. Negative values indicate reductions (red) and positive values indicate increases (green) [@silva2024].

## Temporal beta diversity of WFP [line 229]

**Fig. 4** Temporal beta diversity of wild food plants (hexagons) in the Brazilian semiarid. **a** Temporal beta diversity in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). Temporal beta diversity quantifies the difference in species composition of the same focal cell at two different times (present and future). Temporal beta diversity was partitioned into its components, namely **b** turnover and **c** nestedness [@silva2024].

**Figure SPM.3**: Projected risks and impacts of climate change on natural and human systems at different global warming levels (GWLs) relative to 1850-1900 levels. Projected risks and impacts shown on the maps are based on outputs from different subsets of Earth system and impact models that were used to project each impact indicator without additional adaptation. WGII provides further assessment of the impacts on human and natural systems using these projections and additional lines of evidence. **(b)** Risks to human health as indicated by the days per year of population exposure to hyperthermic conditions that pose a risk of mortality from surface air temperature and humidity conditions for historical period (1991â€“2005) and at GWLs of 1.7Â°Câ€“2.3Â°C (mean = 1.9Â°C; 13 climate models), 2.4Â°Câ€“3.1Â°C (2.7Â°C; 16 climate models) and 4.2Â°Câ€“5.4Â°C (4.7Â°C; 15 climate models). Interquartile ranges of GWLs by 2081â€“2100 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The presented index is consistent with common features found in many indices included within WGI and WGII assessments.
