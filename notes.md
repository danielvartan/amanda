# Introduction [line 52]

## Wild food plants [line 57]

*Fig 3.* Wild food plants with greater potential for popularization, considering the average of the attributes accessed according to the perception of the residents of the rural settlement Dom Helder CÃ¢mara, in the municipality of Murici, state of Alagoas, northeastern Brazil. (**A**) *Psidium guineense* Sw.; (**B**) *American genipa* L.; (**C**) *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* (L.) Schott, and (**D**) *Dioscorea trifida* L.f. [@medeiros2021].

## Question [line 77]

## Objective [line 94]

Here, our objective was to determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of WFPs in the Brazilian semiarid and evaluate their potential availability in future climate change scenarios [@silva2024].

# Methods [line 106]

## The Brazilian semiarid [line 111]

**Fig. 1** Geographic location of the Brazilian semiarid region in the Neotropical realm, with limits highlighted in black on a phytogeographic map. The relative area (%) represents the proportion of each domain in relation to the total area of the semiarid region. Sources: Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Biomes of Brazil, 1:250,000, 2019, Development Superintendency of the North- east (SUDENE), Delimitation of the Semiarid, 2017 [@silva2024].

# Results [line 123]

## The Brazilian semiarid [line 128]

**Fig. 2** Relative balance in the geographical distribution area of wild food plants of the Brazilian semiarid in future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). 
The relative balance (bars) indicates the balance between gain and loss in the distribution area of each species and is proportional to the current (1970â€“2000) distribution area. Boxplots show the median, quartiles, and standard error of the relative balance of all species ($n = 27$) in each future scenario; points represent outliers (*Dipteryx alata Vogel*). Nega- tive values indicate a reduction in distribution area, and positive values indicate an increase [@silva2024].

## Species richness [line 141]

**Fig. 3** Species richness and spatial beta diversity of wild food plants (hexagons) in the Brazilian semiarid. **a** Species richness in the cur- rent scenario (1970â€“2000) and in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). **b** Variation of species richness in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). **c** Spatial beta diversity in the current scenario (1970â€“2000) and in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). Spatial beta diversity quantifies the difference in species composition between a focal cell and its surrounding cells (0.5Â° radius). **d** Variation of spatial beta diversity in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). Boxplots show the median, quartiles, and standard error of the variation ($n = 430$) in each future scenario. Negative values indicate reductions (red) and positive values indicate increases (green) [@silva2024].

## Spatial beta diversity [line 153]

**Fig. 3** Species richness and spatial beta diversity of wild food plants (hexagons) in the Brazilian semiarid. **a** Species richness in the cur- rent scenario (1970â€“2000) and in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). **b** Variation of species richness in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). **c** Spatial beta diversity in the current scenario (1970â€“2000) and in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). Spatial beta diversity quantifies the difference in species composition between a focal cell and its surrounding cells (0.5Â° radius). **d** Variation of spatial beta diversity in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). Boxplots show the median, quartiles, and standard error of the variation ($n = 430$) in each future scenario. Negative values indicate reductions (red) and positive values indicate increases (green) [@silva2024].

## Temporal beta diversity of WFP [line 165]

**Fig. 4** Temporal beta diversity of wild food plants (hexagons) in the Brazilian semiarid. **a** Temporal beta diversity in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060). Temporal beta diversity quantifies the difference in species composition of the same focal cell at two different times (present and future). Temporal beta diversity was partitioned into its components, namely **b** turnover and **c** nestedness [@silva2024].

## Temporal beta diversity of WFP [line 177]

**Fig. 4** Temporal beta diversity of wild food plants (hexagons) in the Brazilian semiarid. **a** Temporal beta diversity in the four future climate change scenarios (2041â€“2060).
